  abstract      = {If the non-zero finite floating-point numbers are interpreted as point
intervals, then the effect of rounding can be interpreted as computing
one of the bounds of the result according to interval arithmetic. We
give an interval interpretation for the signed zeros and infinities, so
that the undefined operations 0*inf, inf - inf, inf/inf, and 0/0 become
defined. In this way no operation remains that gives rise to an error
condition. Mathematically questionable features of the floating-point
standard become well-defined sets of reals. Interval semantics provides
a basis for the verification of numerical algorithms. We derive the
results of the newly defined operations and consider the implications
for hardware implementation.},
